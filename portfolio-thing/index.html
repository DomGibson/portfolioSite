                You Found Me...
            </h2>
            <p>
                My main passion and interest is all to do with cars. I have always had a passion for cars since I was knee high.
            </p>
            <h2>
               Why Do I Like Cars Soooo.... Much? 
            </h2>
            <p>
                Ever since I was a kid I used to collect small Hot-Wheels and like model cars and store them in wine boxes. Wine boxes always had a cool way of presenting a bottle and younger me thought it was the best thing ever, just like a garage.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also used to visit car events and take pictures as well. I have been studying a range of creative arts and media subjects like Graphics Design at College and Photography along side that. I have also had an eye for some kind of design on cars themselves. (feel free to judge...)
            </p>
            <h2>
                What Is My Favourite Car?
            </h2>
            <p>
                It is very hard for me to put my finger on a favourite car. You have to take everything into account when it comes to purpose and performance. Cars now are always changing so my mind has to follow these new trends.
            </p>
            <p>
                I guess for me to decide on a car it would need to be not only a stock model but for an external manufacturer to design the car.

            <p>
                I am a Huuuuuge fan of Mercedes-Benz and the series of Brabus models they have made. I am a massive fan of the G-Wagon/G63 and G500 but I really would love to see a Brabus S500 B50. The car looks immaculate and looks like the all purpose vehicle.
            </p>

        <p>I am currently an apprentice working for a web development company.</p>
        <p>The work I am currently doing is very interesting and some of the features that
            make the designs stand out and become bespoke are the designs that require attention
            to styling and animation.

        <h2>Why I Am Learning JavaScript?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="humpty">
        <p>JavaScript to me is almost a fundamental part of designing any sort
            of website whether it is a portfolio to a companies bespoke design. To me,
            JavaScript can be used for a range of other things and features and will 
            also allow me open new doors to other libraries such as React and Next!
        </p>

        <p>I also want to learn more about the tools that will expose me to more creative
            ways and methods of creating interesting and more personal designs. Not only
            for work but for learning how to get over certain hurdles that I might face.
